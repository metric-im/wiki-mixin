# CamelCase

Camel case, called as such because it requires two 'humps', Is a string of alphanumeric letters with a leading capital
letter and a second, following later. For example CamelCase.

Camel case is an expedient shorthand for indicating a proper noun and thus something may deserve to be linked to a
page with more detail. Like this one. This wiki employs camel case words by automatically linking them to a page
with that name, and if none exists, the opportunity to start one.

This is how to make new pages. You create a link, save the page your own, then follow your link to your new page.

>NOTE: If you want a page named without camel case, use brackets. Like [Home]
